        <p>Servings: 6-8</p>

            <li>⅔ cup (130 milliliters) milk</li>
            <li>4 ounces (100 grams) cream cheese</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons (100 grams) butter</li>
            <li>8 egg yolks</li>
            <li>½ cup (60 grams) flour</li>
            <li>½ cup (60 grams) cornstarch</li>
            <li>13 large egg whites</li>
            <li>⅔ cup (130 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Parchment paper</li>
            <li>Strawberries, to serve</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="preparation">PREPARATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 320°F/160°C.</li>
            <li>In a small pot over medium heat, whisk the milk, cream cheese, and butter until smooth. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then slowly drizzle in the cream mixture, stirring until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and the cornstarch, whisking to make sure there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until you see soft peaks when lifting the mixer up from the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat until you see hard peaks when lifting the mixer up.</li>
            <li>Take about ¼ of the egg whites and fold them into the egg yolk mixture, then repeat with the remaining egg whites until <br>the batter is evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Place a 4-inch parchment paper strip around the edge of a 9x3-inch cake pan that is already lined with parchment at the bottom. <br>If you are using a springform pan, make sure to wrap the bottom and sides completely in foil, twice, to prevent any leakage.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the parchment-lined pan and shake to release any large air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Place the filled pan into a larger baking pan or dish lined with 2 paper towels at the bottom. The paper towels ensure that <br>the heat is distributed evenly along the bottom of the pan. Fill the larger pan with about 1 inch of hot water.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 280°F/135°C and bake for another 55 minutes, until the cake has risen to almost <br>double its height.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, and carefully invert the cake onto your dominant hand and peel off the paper. Be extremely careful, as the <br>cake will be hot. You can also invert the cake onto a plate, but this will cause the cake to deflate more.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the top of the cake with powdered sugar, slice, and serve with strawberries while still warm!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
